Hey!

This is my personal Truth Tables project that I did parallel with my Discrete Mathmatics lessons as a way to practice both Java and Math
my freshman year. 

There are two files (currently), and both are created with the utilization of command line arguments, rather than having everything based
in the actual code via scanners.

Though I initially built it using only JTable and JFrame, I have extended the program to be able to read and write to CSV Excel-Readable
filetypes, with the truthExcelRead reading the first line of the truthTableTitled file to determine which processes are supposed to be run and then
compiled into the TruthTableDelimited.csv file so as to not commit irreprable changes to either files.

The truthCommandLine Java class will use Command Line arguments to determine which processes to run, while TruthTableRead will take a command
line argument to determine which file to read.

Have fun! (I tried to comment as best I could, and I am still updating this as I go)
